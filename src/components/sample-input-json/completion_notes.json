The BRMQ should be completed electronically and submitted through WINGS, the SFC’s online portal.</p>\n              <p>The BRMQ aims to obtain information about the business operations of a licensed corporation and the measures adopted by it to ensure sound management of risks, compliance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and conduct of business activities in a proper manner, including the systems of controls, policies and procedures that it has in place in respect of certain business functions and specific business lines. The SFC recognises that licensed corporations may adopt different controls, policies and procedures to this end given the significant differences that exist in their organisational and legal structures as well as the nature and scope of their business activities. Therefore, the answer options provided in the BRMQ are neither intended to be, nor should it be construed as, an exhaustive or mandatory list of controls, policies and procedures for a licensed corporation’s internal control systems.  </p>\n              <p>There are two sections in the BRMQ. Section A consists of questions relating to operational functions and arrangements that are generally relevant to licensed corporations. Section B consists of questions relating to specific business lines, and a licensed corporation is required to answer only those questions that relate to the business activities undertaken or services provided by it during the present financial year as indicated by the licensed corporation under Section A1. When completing the BRMQ in electronic format, licensed corporations will be directed by skip logic<sup>1</sup> to the questions applicable to them. </p>\n              <p>Licensed corporations are expected to provide responses which most accurately reflect their operations and controls, and should furnish all information requested in the BRMQ (including any statistics and numbers) to the best of their knowledge.  If a licensed corporation finds any questions where the available answer options do not completely describe its situation, it may provide additional, relevant information to supplement or clarify its answers to those questions in the \"Supplementary Information\" section of the BRMQ. </p>\n              <p>To facilitate completion of the BRMQ, there is an option in WINGS that a licensed corporation may select to start with an electronic form of the BRMQ with some answers to the questions pre-populated based on the BRMQ submitted by the licensed corporation electronically for the previous financial year. Licensed corporations however should review the pre-populated answers carefully to ensure that they remain accurate for the present financial year before submission. Alternatively, a licensed corporation may choose to start with a blank electronic form of the BRMQ.</p>\n              <p>Unless defined or the context requires otherwise, terms bear the same meanings given to them in the SFO. </p>\n              <p>If you have any question in relation to the BRMQ, please contact your responsible case officer in the Intermediaries Supervision Department. </p>\n              <br>\n              <div class=\"brmq-note\" style=\"font-style:normal;font-size:12px;\"><sup>1</sup>Skip logic is an information technology feature that directs the licensed corporation to applicable questions in the BRMQ based on the answer options selected in previous questions. </div>  \n            </div></div></div></div>",
